            <strong class="text-stone-900">Key Takeaways:</strong> Every arthritic patient has an abnormal 
            gait that accelerates joint wear. Physical therapy, weight optimization, and muscle strengthening 
            can dramatically reduce symptoms—often avoiding or delaying surgery.

            Let's talk about the rehabilitation for patients who come in with an arthritic knee. First of 
            all, we have to understand that every patient with an arthritic knee has an abnormal gait, and 
            that's because they've favored the knee.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The joint either doesn't move fully or it's become weaker or more painful, and so to protect 
            that joint, they walk with either a little bit of a limp or a protected gait or in a narrow 
            range of motion so that the joint does not go through the full normal arc.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Just like the tires on your car, when it's out of alignment, the tires wear off faster. Your 
            knee joint wears off faster when you walk with a bad gait, and also your hips and your back 
            become painful.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So it's very important that all patients with knee arthritis get started on a careful physical 
            therapy program and a careful exercise program to strengthen the muscles around the knee and 
            around the hip and around the back to strengthen their core muscles and to improve their range 
            of motion.
          </p>
          
          <p class="timestamp-text">
            <span class="timestamp">[01:11]</span>
            We start all of our patients on this program before surgery and continue it on the first day 
            after surgery and then for the rest of their life.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The second thing that's most important about people with knee arthritis is that optimizing their 
            weight is extremely important. And let me explain why.
          </p>
          
          <div class="bg-teal-50 border border-teal-200 p-5 rounded-sm my-6 not-prose">
            <p class="text-stone-800 font-medium mb-2">The Weight Factor</p>
            <p class="text-stone-600 text-sm">
              Normal people take between 2 and 3 million steps per year at up to five times body weight. 
              If you lose 10 pounds, that can be up to <strong>50 pounds less force on your knee, 2-3 million 
              times per year</strong>.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            Also, by strengthening the muscles in your knee, the muscle groups take up more of the force 
            than the joint surface when they're strong, therefore, you decrease the wear and tear on the 
            joint surface, and that's why muscle strengthening is so important to decreasing the pain of 
            arthritis.
          </p>
          
          <p class="timestamp-text">
            <span class="timestamp">[02:13]</span>
            The old advice where we used to tell patients to go home and rest their knee and wait for a 
            total joint replacement is completely thrown out the window now because we tell patients: 
            don't go home. Go to the gym, start exercising, start on a weight loss program, improve your 
            range of motion, and your joint arthritis will feel much better.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We teach people how to lose weight as well. Combined with a good exercise program, we encourage 
            all of our patients to increase their water intake. The easiest way for our patients to diet is 
            to drink two tall glasses of water before they lift the fork at each meal, no eating between 
            meals and an hour of exercise each day, and then they can eat what they want at the meals.
          </p>
          
          <p class="timestamp-text">
            <span class="timestamp">[03:05]</span>
            The reason for this is the water increases their sense of fullness. It acts as portion control. 
            You eat less at that meal. That when combined with an hour of exercise, will lead to usually a 
            one pound weight loss each week, which is a safe weight to start to lose weight and increase 
            your exercise.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            All of our patients with arthritis get started on a weight loss diet, an exercise program, a 
            rehab program for their gait and range of motion before we start on the surgical path. And 
            then many of our patients can avoid surgery.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Additionally, we start all of our patients on glucosamine. Glucosamine in the form of a 
            beverage such as joint juice, can decrease the symptoms of arthritis, decreasing the pain, 
            decreasing the sense of stiffness that patients with arthritis feel.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            And it's not just patients with arthritis. Our athletes notice that when they use glucosamine, 
            they feel less stiff the next day. And this is very important for athletes who want to compete 
            day by day, or our pitchers who want to recover fast after throwing a lot of fastballs.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So glucosamine is an effective way of decreasing stiffness, decreasing pain for our athletes 
            and for patients with arthritis.
